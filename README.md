# CNN_star_galaxy_classifier
This project explores variations in the architecture of a Deep Learning Neural Network designed to recognize and classify images of Stars and Galaxies. The input data took the form of an images with 64 by 64 by 3 pixels. The original data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/dummy-astronomy-data) and contained 942 Galaxy images and 3044 Star images. For the sake of training an impartial model, the Star images were reduced to 942 files via the use of a random state This was a final project for Deep Learning and AI.
